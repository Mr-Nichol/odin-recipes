            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
                
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                
            <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
                
            <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
                
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                
            <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over 
                medium-high heat until crumbly,
                browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes.<br>
                Drain and set aside.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes.<br>
                Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven.<br>
                Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat.<br>
                Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes.<br>
                Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach.<br>
                Cook and stir until spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.
